Honestly,I thought I am watching a silly porn-like comedy\\nmovie.<br><br>Melissa McCarthy portrays the role of Michelle Darnell, a shameless and\\na selfish businesswoman who does everything bad for the sake of her own\\narrogant welfare. Her wicked and reckless behavior led to her\\nimprisonment of course.<br><br>I am totally disappointed with this boring movie because its senseless\\nvulgarity and the lack of comedy made of this film a total waste of\\ntime and a bad movie of the year 2016.\\n', b'\\n<a href=\"/user/ur61780321/\">autisticreviewers</a> <small>from Australia</small><br>\\n<small>11 April 2016</small><br>\\n\\n</div>\\n<p>\\nBen Falcone keeps proving to me that he is a horrible writer and a\\nhorrible director. There is nothing about this film that works. Read on\\nto find out why: We have a female boss by the name of Michelle Darnell\\nwas placed under arrest for Insider Trading. She has just been released\\nand wants to become something huge, something big and ready to become\\n&#x22;America&#x27;s sweetheart.&#x22; All the people she messed over aren&#x27;t quite\\nwilling to forgive her. Very simple plot.<br><br>Melissa Mccarthy is just plain horrible. We all know that her character\\nis unlikable, but this was beyond a joke. In the movie world if you\\ndecide to create a very obnoxious, nasty, mean, and repulsive\\ncharacter...it can work...but the actor/actress playing this character\\nneeds to be able to bring something great to the table and by acting\\ngreatly and making you appreciate this horrible/unlikable character.\\nMelissa Mccarthy does none of this, and therefor makes it completely\\noutrageous and leaving you in total discomfort for a full 90 mins.\\nKristen Bell was horribly casted and was just pointless. Peter Dinklage\\nwas the only decent thing about this film, and he managed to give us a\\nfew chuckles. That&#x27;s the sign of a good actor. But he&#x27;s used as the\\nstereotypical midget and we are laughing at his advantage. Again, it\\njust didn&#x27;t work.<br><br>Women and slapstick comedy - a mixture that fails abysmally. And this\\nmovie does just that. Nothing worked. It was a horrible combination. I\\nwill never watch this again. I disliked Tammy, but this one was even\\nworse! It was just horrible. 1/5 stars. 1/10.

Of course,\\nevery filmmaker needs to be passionate about his/her cinematic\\nendeavor, but there is such a thing as letting emotions get in the way\\nof sound artistic judgment. It often happens when the same person both\\nwrites and directs a movie (his/her &#x22;passion project&#x22;), especially when\\nalso acting in the movie. Then, there&#x27;s an even greater danger of\\nthings going wrong when these kinds of overlaps involve a married\\ncouple. It happened when Dax Shepard wrote, co-directed and starred in\\nthe pointless action-comedy &#x22;Hit and Run&#x22; (2012) which co-starred his\\nreal-life wife Kristen Bell. In 2014, another couple, Melissa McCarthy\\nand Ben Falcone, took the practice of overlapping jobs and complicating\\nit with marriage to another level by co-writing and co-starring in\\n&#x22;Tammy&#x22; while Falcone also directed. That movie made money, but was\\npoorly received by most critics and many Movie Fans as well. 2016 has\\nthe pair taking the same chance with the comedy &#x22;The Boss&#x22; (R, 1:39),\\nwhich, ironically, co-stars Kristen Bell (but her husband is nowhere in\\nsight). So, is &#x22;The Boss&#x22;&#x85; boss? Read on.<br><br>McCarthy stars as Michelle Darnell, a high-powered businesswoman and\\nmotivational speaker whose childhood (back and forth between an\\norphanage and foster care) taught her that the only person she can\\ndepend on is herself. She&#x27;s self-centered, arrogant and basically\\namoral. Michelle generally uses and abuses her personal assistant,\\nClaire (Bell), and Michelle&#x27;s bodyguard isn&#x27;t much more than her\\npersonal hype man. When Michelle is arrested for insider trading and\\nsent to jail for five months, everyone abandons her, former lover and\\nlong-time business rival Renault (Peter Dinklage) buys her companies\\nand the authorities freeze all of her remaining assets. Looks like\\nsomeone has to start all over again.<br><br>When Michelle is released from jail, she doesn&#x27;t have anyone to call or\\nanywhere to go, so she takes a taxi to Claire&#x27;s apartment. When Claire\\ngets home from her new job (where she works for a crazy Darnell\\ndisciple played by SNL&#x27;s Cecily Strong), Claire&#x27;s pre-teen daughter,\\nRachel (Ella Anderson), convinces her mom that they have to do\\nsomething to help Michelle. Claire allows her former boss to stay in\\nthe apartment until she gets back on her feet, but Michelle&#x27;s feet\\nremain reclined on Claire&#x27;s couch until Claire forces Michelle to do\\nsomething to earn her keep. Michelle takes Rachel to her Dandelions\\nmeeting (think Girl Scouts) where the troop leader (Kristen Schaal) is\\ndiscussing their cookie sales.<br><br>Michelle gets an idea that her &#x22;way back&#x22; is to form a group called\\nDarnell&#x27;s Darlings which will teach girls business skills as they sell\\nthe unusually delicious brownies that Claire makes from an old family\\nrecipe. Michelle gets Claire to make the brownies and help with the\\ntroop and gets Rachel to help her recruit various tough girls and other\\nmisfits to join up and sell brownies for a percent of the profits.\\nMichelle also approaches her estranged former mentor (Kathy Bates) for\\nfinancing to help expand the business, but as all this is going on,\\nRenault and his equally evil assistant (Timothy Simons) are keeping\\ntabs on Michelle and her new business, hoping to increase the payback\\nthat he feels her still owes her.<br><br>&#x22;The Boss&#x22; is mostly unoriginal, uninspired, unrealistic and unfunny.\\nThe clich&#xE9;d plot lazily recycles the often used story of a main\\ncharacter who has been hardened by a tough life and doesn&#x27;t know how to\\ngive or receive love. Falcone&#x27;s direction randomly makes use of\\nMcCarthy&#x27;s talent for physical comedy, but rarely gets her or the other\\nactors to show us anything interesting or even very likable about their\\ncharacters. Both the script and the acting give us characters who often\\nchange their tones and their attitudes toward other characters abruptly\\nand with no clear reason why. We also see characters meeting for the\\nfirst time, but acting like they already know each other, again without\\nexplanation.<br><br>There is also a lack of realism in the way the script portrays the\\nfallout from Michelle&#x27;s crimes, and her business dealings as the head\\nof Darnell&#x27;s Darlings, but this comedy&#x27;s biggest flaw is its lack of&#x85;\\ncomedy. There are a few laughs to be found here and there, but the\\nmovie&#x27;s other problems just kill the mood. Besides that, the movie&#x27;s\\nattempts at humor are overly dependent on cartoonish violence involving\\nchildren, cursing around, by and at children, and vulgar sexual\\nreferences which come off as more crude than funny. McCarthy herself\\nhas been much funnier in previous films and hopefully she&#x27;ll be funnier\\nagain in her future projects. Sadly, her character in this film is one\\nboss who should be fired herself. &#x22;D+&#x22;\\n', b'\\n<a href=\"/user/ur39051216/\">drftlussier</a> <small>from United States</small><br>\\n<small>9 April 2016</small><br>\\n\\n</div>\\n<p>\\nIt might be debated which is worse: That the absolute filth of society\\nhave taken over &#x22;film,&#x22; &#x22;music,&#x22; and &#x22;television&#x22; to produce such trash\\nOR that this society has plunged so far into the intellectual and\\ncultural abyss since 1980 that its &#x22;Porky&#x27;s,&#x22; &#x22;Dumb and Dumber,&#x22; and\\n&#x22;The Terminator&#x22; members demand such trash. We can thank this movie and\\nthe similar movies previewed during the 20-minute-long nightmare of\\ntrailers before this trash even began for confirming the validity of\\nhistorical proclamations by Ancient civilizations stating that this\\ntime would be the absolute cultural bottom of the current 26,000-year\\ncycle, while illustrating the extreme mental-retardation that could be\\nachieved by the dumbing-down of America during and since the 1980s.<br><br>A comedy is supposed to help us escape the nightmare of living among\\nthe filth around us not remind us of the nightmare of living among the\\nfilth around us. Not ONE redeemable scene, with the f-word and\\nkindergarten-style references to sexual situations - and among teenage\\ngirls, no less - to the point where, after 45 minutes of the greatest\\ntorture in a long time, the group of six of us left the movie. Yes -\\nRight in the middle of a crowded theater on a Saturday night, six of us\\nup and left, right after a young-teenage GIRL-thug directs the opposing\\ngirl-thugs in a warrior-like stance to &#x22;Suck my d^&#x3C;&#x3E;&#x22;! The night for\\nall of us was ruined, and, during the car-ride to another venue, the\\ndiscussion centered on our profound nausea over our having contributed\\nto the becoming even richer of the filth that produced this trash. And,\\nwhen we see that it has become &#x22;fashionable&#x22; to mimic the\\ncharacteristic below-30-point-IQ-level hip-hop and rap dregs of\\nsociety, we know that we have entered a deeper depth: The time of\\nhistory that DEFIES PARODY. This society, as represented by its\\nentertainment, with this movie as the exemplar, IS a sick parody.\\n', b'\\n<a href=\"/user/ur54088548/\">RebelWithACause94</a> <small>from United States</small><br>\\n<small>6 April 2016</small><br>\\n\\n</div>\\n<p>\\nThis was a bad movie. The movie was not funny. It was boring. I didn&#x27;t\\nlaugh once. The acting is not good. It was very disappointing. The plot\\nwas dull. The directing was bad. The story was unoriginal. The main\\ncharacter was unlikable and annoying. The jokes were bad. I should have\\ngone to see Demolition or Hardcore Henry. I almost fell asleep. It was\\na big letdown. There was no moral. The story felt very outdated. It was\\nworse than Batman V. Superman Dawn of Justice. It was so bad I couldn&#x27;t\\nbelieve it was real. It doesn&#x27;t even deserve a star. It deserves a\\nRazzie because it was so bad. Even my friend didn&#x27;t like it. It needed\\nbetter writing. Please do not see this movie.

I found her raw humor in Bridesmaids and The Heat to be\\nextremely entertaining. But this movie, which presents her as a\\nbusinesswoman in the mold of Martha Stewart, does her a disservice.\\nWhat set McCarthy apart in the movies where she shines is that she&#x27;s\\nthe one being crass and crude, surrounded by more normal people who\\nmake her stand out. In this movie, everyone seems to be trying to be\\njust as crass and crude, if not more so, including the numerous girls\\nplaying Girl-Scout-like cookie sellers who get into a street brawl over\\ncookie-selling territory. Poorly written movie. Not funny. Despite\\nthat, the movie is doing well in the box office. It&#x27;s hard to imagine\\nthe audiences for this. Too crude to take kids.

Do people in Hollywood\\nthink there are no more decent people out here wanting to see good,\\nfunny movies? Nobody left without the mouth or mind of a waste\\ncontainer? If so, they are wrong. The thing is, with this movie in\\nparticular, it could have been very funny. Good cast, fair premise, but\\ninstead we ended up with a film that was nothing much more than\\ngarbage. When a movie ends and everyone is just looking at each other\\nwith, &#x22;What the heck did we just waste money on?&#x22; looks on their faces,\\nit&#x27;s not good. Even worse, waiting for this one to come on, we were\\ntreated to a couple of coming attractions with pictures as bad, or\\nworse. Foul language, as if the writers have completely lost any\\nability to write witty, clever dialogue, or dialogue at all that isn&#x27;t\\nmerely four letter words, over the top sex that, frankly, is not\\ninteresting, is tiresome, and is so over- done. Who decides to spend\\nmoney putting out money for this stuff? Nobody with any intelligence,\\nI&#x27;m thinking. Too bad.

With so much talent, it was painful to watch its lukewarm\\nopening disintegrate into vulgar attempts at cheap laughs that never\\ncame. The whole thing just made me feel sad...and not in a good way.

Actually, the question should be: what\\nis not wrong with this movie? First, except for the final scenes, this\\nmovie is not funny. It mocks women and even worse, young girls. That is\\nnot funny. Second, the movie is poorly acted. Third, the movie\\nexperiments with gender role switching with poor results. Fourth, the\\nprincipal player, Melissa McCarthy just is not funny. She is loud and\\nobnoxious. Actually, it all comes down to this: gals acting like nasty\\nwise-guys just does not work, at least not for this writer. Lucille\\nBall was funny, Joan Davis was funny, Jean Stapleton was funny, Irene\\nRyan was funny, Rosalind Russell was funny, Gracie Allen was funny,\\nShelly Long is funny, Barbra Streisand is funny, Melissa McCarthy is\\nnot funny. Women punching each other in the face is not funny. Young\\ngirls brawling is not funny. What&#x27;s worse, the movie early one\\nestablishes that McCarthy&#x27;s character, the Boss, is a rotten person and\\nshows it. She generates no empathy. She does stuff that is really\\nhurtful and nasty. The one strong male character in this movie, played\\nby a midget who actually is funny, despises the Boss and with good\\nreason: she used him to get a promotion and then dumped him. All the\\ninterpersonal conflicts in the story are caused by her. In fact, she is\\nintensely disliked, and with good reason: the character is nasty. She\\nis pushy, a hustler, loud, obnoxious, aggressive, and physically\\nunattractive. That alone would not necessarily render her humorless.\\nThe problem is that she has no redeeming qualities to make her lovable.\\nShe&#x27;s not warm, endearing, sensitive or even misunderstood by others.\\nHer abrasive personality is as transparent as clear glass. She is not\\nthe victim; she is the perpetrator. And that is not funny. What&#x27;s next:\\na female version of The Three Stooges (Mai, Lara and Coochie)? Or what\\nabout a movie featuring a female version of Harold Lloyd? Or what about\\na movie about a female Sad Sack (Sadie Sack?) Or what about an\\nall-female version of Gomer Pyle, USMC? (Scene: affable but slow-witted\\nGina Pyle is berated by her hysterical sergeant, Vickie Carter).

They are\\ntarnishing McCarthy&#x27;s career. Ever since her Oscar-nominated\\nperformance in &#x27;Bridesmaids&#x27; McCarthy has been hot property in\\nHollywood. Yet nearly everything she has starred in since has been an\\nabysmal movie (with the exception of &#x27;Spy&#x27;). If things continue this\\nway for much longer she will no longer be hot property and her career\\nwill likely fall by the wayside. So to be entrusting the writing of her\\nscripts, at the peak of her career, to herself and her husband (who\\nhave never written before) is nothing short of insane. They first gave\\nit a go in 2014 with &#x27;Tammy&#x27; and the general consensus was that it was\\npretty bad, and yet here they are again two years later with &#x27;The\\nBoss&#x27;, and I can confirm without a shadow of a doubt, it&#x27;s really bad.<br><br>The first thing that comes to mind as being a major issue is the story.\\nSelling cookies and battling a rival group? This wouldn&#x27;t even pass for\\nan episode of a sitcom. I know what you&#x27;re thinking though, if the\\ncharacters are strong enough the story shouldn&#x27;t matter too much. Let\\nme assure you this is far from the case. The characters are dreadful.\\nAlmost every one of them in the film is completely unrealistic and over\\nthe top, and yet at the same time incredibly boring. The jokes are\\namateurish and would struggle to make in immature five-year-old laugh\\nmost of the time. The film also uses the same jokes over and over, at\\none point even twice in a row within the space of a couple of minutes.\\nIf McCarthy really does have the comedic talent to carry Hollywood\\nfilms (which I&#x27;m starting to doubt truth be told) she needs to find a\\nvery fine set of writers to write a script that plays to her strengths.\\nAnd she needs to find them fast.\\n', b'\\n<a href=\"/user/ur66361639/\">nra-05473</a> <small>from Central Valley CA</small><br>\\n<small>11 April 2016</small><br>\\n\\n</div>\\n<p>\\nI was ready for a fun, entertaining comedy and it failed at every\\nlevel.

However, perhaps I am old-fashioned!\\n', b'\\n<a href=\"/user/ur66219465/\">tylervirtual</a> <small>from United States</small><br>\\n<small>9 April 2016</small><br>\\n\\n</div>\\n<p>\\nThis film is a terrible misfire. Melissa Mccarthy has proved with this\\n2nd movie written by her that she cannot write a screenplay. She proved\\nwith Tammy and with The Boss that her talent is restricted to physical\\nhumor with her acting. The Boss is a lazy attempt at a comedy with\\nplenty of horrendous jokes, bad characters, and a weird ass ending that\\nfeels totally out of place because of a fight scene. This entire movie\\nis a mess and the only redemption is that a couple of jokes hit and\\nthat Michelle&#x27;s (Melissa Mccarthy) story arch is that she need&#x27;s to\\nlearn that family is everything this intertwines well with the other\\nmain character&#x27;s story arch which is to find her own self worth. They\\nhave good character contrast but besides that everything else is crap.\\nI made a video movie review on my Youtube Channel if you want to check\\nthat out. Here&#x27;s a link. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rc6WbzHHit8\\n', b'\\n<a href=\"/user/ur3793011/\">jtindahouse</a> <small>from Nelson, New Zealand</small><br>\\n<small>24 April 2016</small><br>\\n\\n</div>\\n<p>\\nLet me start by saying something very bluntly - Melissa McCarthy and\\nher husband Ben Falcone need to stop writing movies. They are\\ntarnishing McCarthy&#x27;s career. Ever since her Oscar-nominated\\nperformance in &#x27;Bridesmaids&#x27; McCarthy has been hot property in\\nHollywood. Yet nearly everything she has starred in since has been an\\nabysmal movie (with the exception of &#x27;Spy&#x27;). If things continue this\\nway for much longer she will no longer be hot property and her career\\nwill likely fall by the wayside. So to be entrusting the writing of her\\nscripts, at the peak of her career, to herself and her husband (who\\nhave never written before) is nothing short of insane. They first gave\\nit a go in 2014 with &#x27;Tammy&#x27; and the general consensus was that it was\\npretty bad, and yet here they are again two years later with &#x27;The\\nBoss&#x27;, and I can confirm without a shadow of a doubt, it&#x27;s really bad.<br><br>The first thing that comes to mind as being a major issue is the story.\\nSelling cookies and battling a rival group? This wouldn&#x27;t even pass for\\nan episode of a sitcom. I know what you&#x27;re thinking though, if the\\ncharacters are strong enough the story shouldn&#x27;t matter too much. Let\\nme assure you this is far from the case. The characters are dreadful.\\nAlmost every one of them in the film is completely unrealistic and over\\nthe top, and yet at the same time incredibly boring. The jokes are\\namateurish and would struggle to make in immature five-year-old laugh\\nmost of the time. The film also uses the same jokes over and over, at\\none point even twice in a row within the space of a couple of minutes.\\nIf McCarthy really does have the comedic talent to carry Hollywood\\nfilms (which I&#x27;m starting to doubt truth be told) she needs to find a\\nvery fine set of writers to write a script that plays to her strengths.\\nAnd she needs to find them fast.\\n', b'\\n<a href=\"/user/ur26680166/\">RforFilm</a> <small>from Murrieta, CA</small><br>\\n<small>12 April 2016</small><br>\\n\\n</div>\\n<p>\\nA story clich&#xE9; that&#x27;s often used for comedies, especially family\\ncomedies, are the ones where an adult is thrown in to the world of a\\nchild&#x27;s, sometimes by choice or by accident, and try to benefit from\\nthat. There is a lot of comedic potential from this kind of\\nfish-out-of-water scenario, considering if their character is out of\\ntheir element or if the children know more about the subject that the\\nmain character is about to face. Movies like Bushwacked, Troop Beverly\\nHills and even Ernest Goes to Camp not only uses this story element,\\nbut also throws in the theme of camping or scouting.<br><br>This also has comedic potential (even if the previous examples aren&#x27;t\\ngood ones), as the idea of scouting is often the first time children\\nget the chance to become adults while retaining innocence, and yet the\\nadult in question would be getting a dose of how much harder it can be\\nto return to such a carefree time. One element that turns girls into\\nwomen is when their tasked to selling cookies for their troop. Rather\\nthen tackle this idea as a family film, The Boss goes for a full, hard\\nR rated comedy the tries to push how bad a person can be. <br><br>Michelle Darnell (played by Melissa McCarthy) is a successful\\nbusinesswoman (I don&#x27;t think were told exactly what it is she made or\\ndid) who prides herself through expensive self-help seminars and daily\\nrichly living. She cares little for anyone, even her never sleeping\\nassistant Clair Rawlins (played by Kristen Bell). One day, Michelle&#x27;s\\nbusiness enemy, a Japanese culture loving Renault (played by Peter\\nDinklage), exposes her insider trading, which puts her in prison for\\nfive months, along with her property seized by the government and her\\nbank accounts frozen, putting back at square one.<br><br>With no place to go and no one willing to work with her, she shows up\\nat the front door of Claire, who lives with her young daughter Rachel,\\nand has taken a new job. She lets Michelle stay with them, but forces\\nher to help out, including taking Rachel to her scouting meeting. It&#x27;s\\nhere where she discovers that the girl&#x27;s troop sells a high amount of\\ncookies. It&#x27;s here where she&#x27;s inspired to make a brand new scouting\\ntroop that sells brownies that are cooked by Claire and twenty percent\\nof the profits go back to the girls.<br><br>While I wouldn&#x27;t call Melissa McCarthy a comedic genius, but you&#x27;d\\nthink a talent like her would have had a lot more to offer for The\\nBoss. Directed by McCarthy&#x27;s husband Ben Falcone (who also directed the\\nreally bad Tammy), much of The Boss rides on how foul she can be in\\nfront of children. This wouldn&#x27;t be a bad thing, but like how Tammy\\nattempted to put in some unneeded drama, this also tries to sneak in\\nsome schmaltzy material about the importance of family and such. That&#x27;s\\nnot going to work as this is supposed to be an R rated story for adults\\nand not for kids.<br><br>Making an R rated movie around something that&#x27;s supposed to be child\\nfriendly is a extremely tough sell and this movie justifies why\\nsomething like The Boss shouldn&#x27;t be pursued without an intelligent\\nscript. As is, I laughed a few times, but mostly by how insane McCarthy\\ncan be with her character. Both Kristen Bell and Peter Dinklage try\\ntheir best, but the material gives them little to work with, and their\\nstuck telling predictable jokes with a predictable story. <br><br>I&#x27;ll give this three boxes of cookies out of ten. The Boss is a mostly\\nforgettable comedy that we can toss into the bargain bin that will\\nprobably satisfy those that want cheap laughs. I hope McCarthy can show\\na lot more creative idea with her upcoming Ghostbusters movie. I know\\nshe&#x27;s capable of a ton of laughs (no pun on her weight).\\n']\n"

The jokes and fun parts\\nwere on point, and the world the movie created felt very authentic,\\nimmersive and a joy to watch on the big screen - this was helped by\\namazing costuming and cinematography.<br><br>The entire cast had very strong chemistry between them, and both\\nHathaway and De Niro were wonderful.<br><br>Overall an awesome, heartwarming movie.

The theater was close\\nto being packed with men, woman and children. The movie was\\nsurprisingly quite funny; didn&#x27;t know anything about it before viewing.\\nThe entire theater ended up cracking up numerous times. There were\\nvarious times I felt bad for De Niro&#x27;s character, but he was optimistic\\nand didn&#x27;t let it effect him, so it was great. There were a couple of\\ninstances I would have never guessed things about the movie. There is\\none scenario in the story that is tough; what would you do if put in\\nthat circumstance. I believe ages 20-80 can relate to this movie. We\\nhad De Niro&#x27;s aspect as well as Hathaway&#x27;s. Good storyline. The\\n&#x22;Intern&#x22; group of guys were funny too. I&#x27;d see this again.\\n', b'\\n<a href=\"/user/ur1866601/\">Jerghal</a> <small>from Belgium</small><br>\\n<small>3 January 2016</small><br>\\n\\n</div>\\n<p>\\nThe Intern is a perfect example of the soulless crap Hollywood dares to\\ncrank out. De Niro plays a retired 70 year old who is bored to death\\nand therefore seeks to work for free as an intern for a booming\\ne-commerce company run by Ann Hathaway. The film feels like one big fat\\ncommercial (and it actually is). At this hipster e-com company everyone\\nworks on Macs, Ann drives an Audi, she lives in a residential hipster\\nhouse. She drinks Stella Artois beer (they make sure you see the\\nlabel), brand names are also dropped (lego, Netflix), other products\\nare also clearly visible; Starbucks, Sony, Skype, Samsung,.. Even the\\nmusic sounds like music from a commercial (not joking!). Al these\\n&#x27;people&#x27; in the movie are the examples of successful hipsters and the\\n&#x27;problems&#x27; they have are just first world problems. I also could not\\nstand the characters: all these conflict avoiding, apologetic, overly\\nhelpful nitwits. If you see De Niro playing this cardboard character\\n(it&#x27;s written that way, he tries his best with it) it&#x27;s hard to believe\\nthis was the guy who played in Taxi Driver. The Intern is also so\\nPolitically Correct it&#x27;s sickening. You can feel being manipulated\\nwhile watching this garbage. It felt like these subliminal messages in\\nThey Live. People should not have paid to see this, they should have\\nbeen paid to spend 2 hours being pounded by this extensive commercial\\nmarinated in a forced &#x27;feel good&#x27; message.\\n', b'\\n<a href=\"/user/ur12093587/\">Dr_Sagan</a> <small>from the Edge of the Cosmos</small><br>\\n<small>2 January 2016</small><br>\\n\\n</div>\\n<p>\\nNancy Meyers is nearly 70 years old and this script seems like an\\nattempt to prove that her generation had the answers for pretty much\\nanything.<br><br>Baby boomers everywhere united! You are still needed to share the\\nwisdom. Next generations are only to show you how your laptop opens and\\nhow to create an account to facebook.<br><br>I guess there countless movies like this. You know some &#x22;back in\\nschool&#x22; flicks where the old guy or girl returns to &#x22;school&#x22; and\\ninstantly becomes one with the &#x22;kids&#x22; and gives life lessons to the\\nyoungsters, how to treat a girl, how to be punctual, about honesty and\\nfidelity. Next generations are just email-exchanging idiots.<br><br>Anyway. Despite the whole &#x22;wisdom&#x22; and &#x22;life begins at 70&#x22; crap, that\\nare simply not true, you have 3 extremely capable and experienced\\nactors (DeNiro, Hathaway, Russo) delivering the easygoing script and\\nshowing enough chemistry to make the film bearable. There is obviously\\nan uplifting mood (the self made millionaire girl etc. etc.) but there\\nare troubles in Paradise. You can&#x27;t have it all. Success and solid\\nfamily and be happy.

It&#x27;s hard to find a movie that is respectable and\\nclean, with charm and wit, one that is suitable for thinking adults.\\n&#x22;The Intern&#x22; is such a movie. <br><br>Robert DeNiro is superb. How a guy who played such ruthless characters\\nin &#x22;Goodfellas&#x22; and &#x22;Taxi Driver&#x22; can pull off this avuncular gentlemen\\nis a testament to his craft. His Ben Whittaker almost seems too\\nperfect, but DeNiro brings a humanity that makes him eminently\\nbelievable. Anne Hathaway does a fine turn as the Internet\\nentrepreneur, and fleshes out well what could have been a cartoon\\ncharacter of the &#xDC;bermom. The supporting cast supports wonderfully,\\ngiving the stars plenty of room to shine, not distracting from the\\nstory. And the plot never goes where it shouldn&#x27;t, something that does\\nhappen in other, more cynical films. <br><br>So I would very highly recommend this film. It has some &#x22;legs,&#x22; as\\nevidenced by the fairly sizable audience given that it&#x27;s in its sixth\\nweek of release. You know why?

He is perfection. There are some actors\\nthat the older they get, the better they get, and De Niro is most\\ncertainly one. Anne Hathaway, as the genius behind a too-fast growing\\ncompany is playing what I consider one of her best roles yet. And Rene\\nRusso is still gorgeous as ever. I was impressed, also, by Anders Holm\\nwho played Hathaway&#x27;s husband. But then, actually, I was impressed with\\neveryone in this movie. There really wasn&#x27;t a single thing or character\\nI would change in this one, and that&#x27;s saying something. The casting,\\nthe plot, the dialogue&#x85;and fancy this, it was a funny, touching,\\nenjoyable picture with NO foul language, NO overly-suggestive crude\\ngarbage that usually just makes the audience cringe. It was well\\nwritten, well -acted, and well presented. All rare these days where\\njust the writing ability seems to have dwindled into the dirt. This one\\nis evidence that there are still writers and creators who have talent\\nout there. More movie producers should make a point of seeking and\\nfinding them! This is a fun movie that you are going to be recommending\\nto everyone within reading or hearing distance. One of the best films\\nwe&#x27;ve seen in some time and left us all smiling as we left the\\nbuilding.\\n']\n"
