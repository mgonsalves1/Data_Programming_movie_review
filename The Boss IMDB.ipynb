They are\\ntarnishing McCarthy&#x27;s career. Ever since her Oscar-nominated\\nperformance in &#x27;Bridesmaids&#x27; McCarthy has been hot property in\\nHollywood. Yet nearly everything she has starred in since has been an\\nabysmal movie (with the exception of &#x27;Spy&#x27;). If things continue this\\nway for much longer she will no longer be hot property and her career\\nwill likely fall by the wayside. So to be entrusting the writing of her\\nscripts, at the peak of her career, to herself and her husband (who\\nhave never written before) is nothing short of insane. They first gave\\nit a go in 2014 with &#x27;Tammy&#x27; and the general consensus was that it was\\npretty bad, and yet here they are again two years later with &#x27;The\\nBoss&#x27;, and I can confirm without a shadow of a doubt, it&#x27;s really bad.<br><br>The first thing that comes to mind as being a major issue is the story.\\nSelling cookies and battling a rival group? This wouldn&#x27;t even pass for\\nan episode of a sitcom. I know what you&#x27;re thinking though, if the\\ncharacters are strong enough the story shouldn&#x27;t matter too much. Let\\nme assure you this is far from the case. The characters are dreadful.\\nAlmost every one of them in the film is completely unrealistic and over\\nthe top, and yet at the same time incredibly boring. The jokes are\\namateurish and would struggle to make in immature five-year-old laugh\\nmost of the time. The film also uses the same jokes over and over, at\\none point even twice in a row within the space of a couple of minutes.\\nIf McCarthy really does have the comedic talent to carry Hollywood\\nfilms (which I&#x27;m starting to doubt truth be told) she needs to find a\\nvery fine set of writers to write a script that plays to her strengths.\\nAnd she needs to find them fast.\\n', b'\\n<a href=\"/user/ur19822838/\">professorscott</a> <small>from Seattle</small><br>\\n<small>13 April 2016</small><br>\\n<p><b>*** This review may contain spoilers ***</b>', b'\\n<a href=\"/user/ur66361639/\">nra-05473</a> <small>from Central Valley CA</small><br>\\n<small>11 April 2016</small><br>\\n\\n</div>\\n<p>\\nI was ready for a fun, entertaining comedy and it failed at every\\nlevel. Melissa and her hubby should not ever collaborate on a venture\\nagain, the writing and execution was forced which did not flow.

Actually, the question should be: what\\nis not wrong with this movie? First, except for the final scenes, this\\nmovie is not funny. It mocks women and even worse, young girls. That is\\nnot funny. Second, the movie is poorly acted. Third, the movie\\nexperiments with gender role switching with poor results. Fourth, the\\nprincipal player, Melissa McCarthy just is not funny. She is loud and\\nobnoxious. Actually, it all comes down to this: gals acting like nasty\\nwise-guys just does not work, at least not for this writer. Lucille\\nBall was funny, Joan Davis was funny, Jean Stapleton was funny, Irene\\nRyan was funny, Rosalind Russell was funny, Gracie Allen was funny,\\nShelly Long is funny, Barbra Streisand is funny, Melissa McCarthy is\\nnot funny. Women punching each other in the face is not funny. Young\\ngirls brawling is not funny. What&#x27;s worse, the movie early one\\nestablishes that McCarthy&#x27;s character, the Boss, is a rotten person and\\nshows it. She generates no empathy. She does stuff that is really\\nhurtful and nasty. The one strong male character in this movie, played\\nby a midget who actually is funny, despises the Boss and with good\\nreason: she used him to get a promotion and then dumped him. All the\\ninterpersonal conflicts in the story are caused by her. In fact, she is\\nintensely disliked, and with good reason: the character is nasty. She\\nis pushy, a hustler, loud, obnoxious, aggressive, and physically\\nunattractive. That alone would not necessarily render her humorless.\\nThe problem is that she has no redeeming qualities to make her lovable.\\nShe&#x27;s not warm, endearing, sensitive or even misunderstood by others.\\nHer abrasive personality is as transparent as clear glass. She is not\\nthe victim; she is the perpetrator. And that is not funny. What&#x27;s next:\\na female version of The Three Stooges (Mai, Lara and Coochie)? Or what\\nabout a movie featuring a female version of Harold Lloyd? Or what about\\na movie about a female Sad Sack (Sadie Sack?) Or what about an\\nall-female version of Gomer Pyle, USMC? (Scene: affable but slow-witted\\nGina Pyle is berated by her hysterical sergeant, Vickie Carter). Or\\nwhat about an updated version of All in the Family with Archie\\ntransformed into Alma, Edith into Alma&#x27;s clueless husband Eddie, Gloria\\ninto Alma&#x27;s hysterical son Glen and Mike into Alma&#x27;s obnoxious\\ndaughter-in-law Midge?

There is a lot of comedic potential from this kind of\\nfish-out-of-water scenario, considering if their character is out of\\ntheir element or if the children know more about the subject that the\\nmain character is about to face. Movies like Bushwacked, Troop Beverly\\nHills and even Ernest Goes to Camp not only uses this story element,\\nbut also throws in the theme of camping or scouting.<br><br>This also has comedic potential (even if the previous examples aren&#x27;t\\ngood ones), as the idea of scouting is often the first time children\\nget the chance to become adults while retaining innocence, and yet the\\nadult in question would be getting a dose of how much harder it can be\\nto return to such a carefree time. One element that turns girls into\\nwomen is when their tasked to selling cookies for their troop. Rather\\nthen tackle this idea as a family film, The Boss goes for a full, hard\\nR rated comedy the tries to push how bad a person can be. <br><br>Michelle Darnell (played by Melissa McCarthy) is a successful\\nbusinesswoman (I don&#x27;t think were told exactly what it is she made or\\ndid) who prides herself through expensive self-help seminars and daily\\nrichly living. She cares little for anyone, even her never sleeping\\nassistant Clair Rawlins (played by Kristen Bell). One day, Michelle&#x27;s\\nbusiness enemy, a Japanese culture loving Renault (played by Peter\\nDinklage), exposes her insider trading, which puts her in prison for\\nfive months, along with her property seized by the government and her\\nbank accounts frozen, putting back at square one.<br><br>With no place to go and no one willing to work with her, she shows up\\nat the front door of Claire, who lives with her young daughter Rachel,\\nand has taken a new job. She lets Michelle stay with them, but forces\\nher to help out, including taking Rachel to her scouting meeting. It&#x27;s\\nhere where she discovers that the girl&#x27;s troop sells a high amount of\\ncookies. It&#x27;s here where she&#x27;s inspired to make a brand new scouting\\ntroop that sells brownies that are cooked by Claire and twenty percent\\nof the profits go back to the girls.<br><br>While I wouldn&#x27;t call Melissa McCarthy a comedic genius, but you&#x27;d\\nthink a talent like her would have had a lot more to offer for The\\nBoss. Directed by McCarthy&#x27;s husband Ben Falcone (who also directed the\\nreally bad Tammy), much of The Boss rides on how foul she can be in\\nfront of children. This wouldn&#x27;t be a bad thing, but like how Tammy\\nattempted to put in some unneeded drama, this also tries to sneak in\\nsome schmaltzy material about the importance of family and such. That&#x27;s\\nnot going to work as this is supposed to be an R rated story for adults\\nand not for kids.<br><br>Making an R rated movie around something that&#x27;s supposed to be child\\nfriendly is a extremely tough sell and this movie justifies why\\nsomething like The Boss shouldn&#x27;t be pursued without an intelligent\\nscript. As is, I laughed a few times, but mostly by how insane McCarthy\\ncan be with her character. Both Kristen Bell and Peter Dinklage try\\ntheir best, but the material gives them little to work with, and their\\nstuck telling predictable jokes with a predictable story. <br><br>I&#x27;ll give this three boxes of cookies out of ten. The Boss is a mostly\\nforgettable comedy that we can toss into the bargain bin that will\\nprobably satisfy those that want cheap laughs. I hope McCarthy can show\\na lot more creative idea with her upcoming Ghostbusters movie. I know\\nshe&#x27;s capable of a ton of laughs (no pun on her weight).\\n']\n"
