It just\\ngive you that positive thoughts and energy within a lovely comedian\\nscenario. <br><br>I loved how they mix between the classic culture with the modern one.\\nIt was very interesting to watch how they remind our generation about\\nthe habits which they are missing from the classic one.<br><br>De Niro and Anne Hathaway have excellent work chemistry. Director and\\ncamera teams made a great job too... Team work, thank you for this\\nlovely movie...\\n', b'\\n<a href=\"/user/ur62823742/\">Alex Dumitru</a><br>\\n<small>24 September 2015</small><br>\\n\\n</div>\\n<p>\\nI saw the trailer for &#x27;The Intern&#x27; sometime ago, advertised before &#x27;Spy\\n(2015)&#x27;. I liked the premise and the two lead actors, so today (the\\npremiere in Romania) I had to watch it.<br><br>I expected a fun, neat comedy but what I experienced was so much more:\\na great plot, brilliantly executed and acted. The jokes and fun parts\\nwere on point, and the world the movie created felt very authentic,\\nimmersive and a joy to watch on the big screen - this was helped by\\namazing costuming and cinematography.<br><br>The entire cast had very strong chemistry between them, and both\\nHathaway and De Niro were wonderful.<br><br>Overall an awesome, heartwarming movie.

The sweetest, most perfect And heart touching I have\\nseen in a long time. Of course it helps that Robert De Niro is there\\nbut what a movie! This is what all movies should be.<br><br>Robert De Niro plays the perfect gentleman, the kind we don&#x27;t see\\nanymore. And every woman who sees the movie will fall a bit in love\\nwith him. Anne Hathaway perfectly plays the role of a successful\\nentrepreneur, a working wife and mom who thinks about everything and\\neveryone and still feels guilty about being a working woman, even after\\nthe perfect gentleman tells her He should not be the feminist amongst\\nthe two of them. Every working woman will identify with her inner\\nstruggles. The story is perfect, with the perfect practical ending, as\\nlife is always more practical than idealistic. The small touches like\\nthe housewives who look down upon the working mom and make her feel\\nguilty (I have seen many of those), the successful aggressive\\nentrepreneur&#x27;s fear of hurting her mom, the stay-at-home dad&#x27;s\\nend-of-day exhaustion that the working mom does not really understand\\nand the young boss&#x27; discomfort with her elderly intern... All so real.\\nThere&#x27;s an idea here which I spoke about long back... The huge talent\\npool of retired people nobody is willing to hire. The intern&#x27;s wisdom\\nand practicality brings a calm and peace to the busy boss&#x27; life.\\nThere&#x27;s a lesson here for us all here. Look at our elders and learn\\nfrom them. Stop a while in your busy life to get more out of it.<br><br>Loved the movie, hope everyone of my generation sees it.\\n', b'\\n<a href=\"/user/ur23415028/\">moviexclusive</a> <small>from Singapore</small><br>\\n<small>21 September 2015</small><br>\\n<p><b>*** This review may contain spoilers ***</b>', b'\\n<a href=\"/user/ur0281280/\">Ricardo-36</a> <small>from S&#xE3;o Paulo, Brazil</small><br>\\n<small>1 October 2015</small><br>\\n<p><b>*** This review may contain spoilers ***</b>', b'\\n<a href=\"/user/ur24001241/\">chaplinman13</a> <small>from Insight into the future...</small><br>\\n<small>17 September 2015</small><br>\\n\\n</div>\\n<p>\\nI caught an advance screening of this last night. The theater was close\\nto being packed with men, woman and children. The movie was\\nsurprisingly quite funny; didn&#x27;t know anything about it before viewing.\\nThe entire theater ended up cracking up numerous times. There were\\nvarious times I felt bad for De Niro&#x27;s character, but he was optimistic\\nand didn&#x27;t let it effect him, so it was great. There were a couple of\\ninstances I would have never guessed things about the movie. There is\\none scenario in the story that is tough; what would you do if put in\\nthat circumstance. I believe ages 20-80 can relate to this movie. We\\nhad De Niro&#x27;s aspect as well as Hathaway&#x27;s. Good storyline. The\\n&#x22;Intern&#x22; group of guys were funny too.

De Niro plays a retired 70 year old who is bored to death\\nand therefore seeks to work for free as an intern for a booming\\ne-commerce company run by Ann Hathaway. The film feels like one big fat\\ncommercial (and it actually is). At this hipster e-com company everyone\\nworks on Macs, Ann drives an Audi, she lives in a residential hipster\\nhouse. She drinks Stella Artois beer (they make sure you see the\\nlabel), brand names are also dropped (lego, Netflix), other products\\nare also clearly visible; Starbucks, Sony, Skype, Samsung,.. Even the\\nmusic sounds like music from a commercial (not joking!). Al these\\n&#x27;people&#x27; in the movie are the examples of successful hipsters and the\\n&#x27;problems&#x27; they have are just first world problems. I also could not\\nstand the characters: all these conflict avoiding, apologetic, overly\\nhelpful nitwits. If you see De Niro playing this cardboard character\\n(it&#x27;s written that way, he tries his best with it) it&#x27;s hard to believe\\nthis was the guy who played in Taxi Driver. The Intern is also so\\nPolitically Correct it&#x27;s sickening. You can feel being manipulated\\nwhile watching this garbage. It felt like these subliminal messages in\\nThey Live. People should not have paid to see this, they should have\\nbeen paid to spend 2 hours being pounded by this extensive commercial\\nmarinated in a forced &#x27;feel good&#x27; message.\\n', b'\\n<a href=\"/user/ur12093587/\">Dr_Sagan</a> <small>from the Edge of the Cosmos</small><br>\\n<small>2 January 2016</small><br>\\n\\n</div>\\n<p>\\nNancy Meyers is nearly 70 years old and this script seems like an\\nattempt to prove that her generation had the answers for pretty much\\nanything.<br><br>Baby boomers everywhere united! You are still needed to share the\\nwisdom. Next generations are only to show you how your laptop opens and\\nhow to create an account to facebook.<br><br>I guess there countless movies like this. You know some &#x22;back in\\nschool&#x22; flicks where the old guy or girl returns to &#x22;school&#x22; and\\ninstantly becomes one with the &#x22;kids&#x22; and gives life lessons to the\\nyoungsters, how to treat a girl, how to be punctual, about honesty and\\nfidelity. Next generations are just email-exchanging idiots.<br><br>Anyway. Despite the whole &#x22;wisdom&#x22; and &#x22;life begins at 70&#x22; crap, that\\nare simply not true, you have 3 extremely capable and experienced\\nactors (DeNiro, Hathaway, Russo) delivering the easygoing script and\\nshowing enough chemistry to make the film bearable. There is obviously\\nan uplifting mood (the self made millionaire girl etc. etc.) but there\\nare troubles in Paradise. You can&#x27;t have it all. Success and solid\\nfamily and be happy. That&#x27;s the message here, although in the movies\\nanything could happen...\\n', b'\\n<a href=\"/user/ur6799867/\">dancing15bear</a> <small>from United States</small><br>\\n<small>1 November 2015</small><br>\\n\\n</div>\\n<p>\\nSometimes you go to the theater, and you cringe at some of the\\npreviews, most of which are full of sex, violence, and an apocalyptic\\nview of the world. It&#x27;s hard to find a movie that is respectable and\\nclean, with charm and wit, one that is suitable for thinking adults.\\n&#x22;The Intern&#x22; is such a movie. <br><br>Robert DeNiro is superb. How a guy who played such ruthless characters\\nin &#x22;Goodfellas&#x22; and &#x22;Taxi Driver&#x22; can pull off this avuncular gentlemen\\nis a testament to his craft. His Ben Whittaker almost seems too\\nperfect, but DeNiro brings a humanity that makes him eminently\\nbelievable. Anne Hathaway does a fine turn as the Internet\\nentrepreneur, and fleshes out well what could have been a cartoon\\ncharacter of the &#xDC;bermom. The supporting cast supports wonderfully,\\ngiving the stars plenty of room to shine, not distracting from the\\nstory. And the plot never goes where it shouldn&#x27;t, something that does\\nhappen in other, more cynical films. <br><br>So I would very highly recommend this film. It has some &#x22;legs,&#x22; as\\nevidenced by the fairly sizable audience given that it&#x27;s in its sixth\\nweek of release. You know why?

He is perfection. There are some actors\\nthat the older they get, the better they get, and De Niro is most\\ncertainly one. Anne Hathaway, as the genius behind a too-fast growing\\ncompany is playing what I consider one of her best roles yet. And Rene\\nRusso is still gorgeous as ever. I was impressed, also, by Anders Holm\\nwho played Hathaway&#x27;s husband. But then, actually, I was impressed with\\neveryone in this movie. There really wasn&#x27;t a single thing or character\\nI would change in this one, and that&#x27;s saying something. The casting,\\nthe plot, the dialogue&#x85;and fancy this, it was a funny, touching,\\nenjoyable picture with NO foul language, NO overly-suggestive crude\\ngarbage that usually just makes the audience cringe. It was well\\nwritten, well -acted, and well presented. All rare these days where\\njust the writing ability seems to have dwindled into the dirt. This one\\nis evidence that there are still writers and creators who have talent\\nout there. More movie producers should make a point of seeking and\\nfinding them! This is a fun movie that you are going to be recommending\\nto everyone within reading or hearing distance.

Even with the great recession almost over, the\\nmillennial generation faces a new world of hard debt and technological\\ncompetition. They also face a high number of equally qualified\\ncandidates that are more then willing to work for wage, and even for\\nnothing, for the hope that they may receive an offer for a better job\\nwithin the company their working for. My second job was also an intern\\nposition that paid nothing in exchange for experience. I didn&#x27;t stay\\nwith the company, but I learned a lot about working in the Hollywood\\nindustry and even in an office environment.<br><br>Why are a lot of people willing to work for free? Perhaps with the way\\nthe economy is recovering, more companies cannot offer as many paying\\njobs, yet most people are still intrigued by having a particular\\nbusiness on their resume, with another thing to boast about. Who\\nwouldn&#x27;t want something like Amazon, Apple, or Google within their\\ncredentials? Tech businesses are the rage and everyone seems to be\\ntrying their hardest to get in just so they could say they were in. The\\nIntern boasts it&#x27;s own account of a trainee who may be a few years\\nolder, but just as able bodied and ambitious as the next guy.<br><br>Former phone book executive Ben Whittaker (played by Robert De Niro)\\nhas traveled the world and spent his retirement trying to relax and\\nenjoy new hobbies like Tai Chi.

His impressive resume and video resume lands him\\na job for a growing e-commerce fashion company that&#x27;s in the same\\nbuilding that Ben had worked in for many years.<br><br>His boss is the positive, but still intimidating Jules Ostin (played by\\nAnne Hathaway) who find that Ben has been assigned to her. At first,\\nshe assumes that he is too old to contribute a whole lot and give him\\neasy work. Only when her chauffeur becomes drunk and Ben takes over\\nthat Jules starts to warm up. Ben engages further with her business and\\neven with her family. <br><br>Jules in informed by her board that she should find someone else to act\\nas C.E.O. for her company to make the business more professional as it\\nhad grown in such a fast eighteen months. Ben does his best to help\\nJules while she contemplates her decision.<br><br>On the surface, The Intern sounds like the kind of movie that would be\\neasy to cater to older audiences with it&#x27;s wholly positive attitude.\\nFor the most it is, but part of me enjoyed it a lot more then I thought\\nI would. A lot of that has to do with Robert De Niro who still puts a\\nlot into his role. It may be no Taxi Driver or Cape Fear, but he still\\nseems to be saying a lot with how to relaxed the millennial generation\\nhas become. <br><br>Story wise, The Intern is nothing of a challenge; it&#x27;s your nice story\\nabout the misunderstanding of someone&#x27;s skills while making a friend.\\nI&#x27;m still on board as the movie&#x27;s tone relies on the nice chemistry\\nthat De Niro and Hathaway share. I&#x27;m really glad they don&#x27;t attempt any\\nhint of romance and keep them as friends. A racy art house movie might\\nhave taken on that notion, but director Nancy Meyers knew what her\\naudience wanted. In short format, The Intern is a cute movie. It&#x27;s\\nlikable and while not a hilarious movie, did manage to get a few laughs\\nout of me.<br><br>I&#x27;ll give this six and a half e-commerce sites out of ten. The Intern\\nshouldn&#x27;t have trouble finding an audience.

A feel-good mainstream movie\\nfeaturing two big time movie stars will likely have box office success\\nand cause a lot of people to laugh out loud. In other words, the latest\\nfrom writer/director Nancy Meyers should be celebrated for its\\nentertainment value, rather than picked apart by film critics. OK, I&#x27;ll\\ngive it a try.<br><br>Robert DeNiro stars as Ben Whittaker, a retired 70 year old widower,\\nwho just can&#x27;t seem to find meaning in hobbies and the leisure life. He\\napplies and is selected for the &#x22;Senior Intern&#x22; program at About the\\nFit, a fast-growing online clothing company run by its founder Jules\\nOstin (Anne Hathaway). In addition to being a Type A driven and\\nobsessed with details company leader (the type that rides her bike\\nthrough the office to save time), Jules also has a husband, a young\\ndaughter and a fabulous brownstone. What she doesn&#x27;t have is enough\\nsleep, any friends, or enough time to enjoy any of the good stuff. It&#x27;s\\nquite all right if a buddy flick with DeNiro and Hathaway seems unusual\\nto you.<br><br>At the same time Ben arrives on the scene, Jules is struggling with her\\ninvestors&#x27; decision to hire a more experienced CEO so that the company\\ncan maintain its phenomenal growth. That&#x27;s about as deep as the\\nbusiness talk ever gets (but just try to keep track of all the Apple\\nproduct placements). Jules initially spurns Ben, but of course, he soon\\nbecomes invaluable around the office, and while blinking his eyes,\\nbecomes her most valued confidant and adviser.<br><br>Much of the comedy is derived from Ben&#x27;s interactions with the young\\nemployees. It&#x27;s quite simply a &#x27;generation gap comedy&#x27; that makes all\\nthe points it needs to make without really breaking a sweat: senior\\ncitizens are a wealth of knowledge and can bring value to an\\norganization or relationship, young people can learn from elders (it&#x27;s\\nOK to shave everyday and dress for success) &#x85; and vice versa (computers\\nare our friend), there still exists some animosity between stay at home\\nmoms and working moms, stay at home dads face challenges of their own,\\nrunning a company is hard work both physically and mentally,\\ncommunication often requires more than a text or email, and staying\\ntrue to one&#x27;s self is not always easy.<br><br>Ms. Meyers has brought us other mainstream films such as It&#x27;s\\nComplicated (2009) and Something&#x27;s Gotta Give (2003), and she has a\\nfeel for presenting the upper-middle class as a punchline for the\\nmasses. She likes showing successful people in uncomfortable situations\\n&#x85; leaning heavy on awkward, while avoiding dangerous altogether. Her\\nlatest is a feel good movie that makes you laugh, without causing you\\nto think about anything in your life that might bring you down. And\\nthere is real value in that.<br><br>OK, I tried, but there are some things that must be pointed out. There\\nwas so much of Ms. Meyers&#x27; script that was begging to be pushed to the\\nedge and analyzed from a societal aspect. Her specialty is rounding off\\nthe corners so that no one gets hurt, and because of that the film is\\nbereft of conflict &#x85; the single most important element for a meaningful\\nscene. For example, the conflict between Jules and her husband occurs\\nin a hotel room, which would be fine except &#x85; only one of them is\\nthere! Also, we never really get any of the story from Ben&#x27;s\\nperspective. Instead, we are just to believe that his Gandhi-like\\ninfluence on co-workers is the only reward he seeks. I also found\\nmyself bothered a bit in the quick glimpse we get into Ben&#x27;s personal\\nlife. He blows off the advances of Linda Lavin and pursues Rene Russo &#x85;\\nunderstandable, but a bit off-putting given that this female writer\\nchose to have him hook up with the 11 years younger character, rather\\nthan the one closer to his own age. There are many other similar type\\nissues that warrant discussion, but that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s best to just sit\\nback and enjoy this one, rather than asking &#x22;what if?&#x22;\\n', b'\\n<a href=\"/user/ur44112735/\">A_Different_Drummer</a> <small>from North America</small><br>\\n<small>12 December 2015</small><br>\\n\\n</div>\\n<p>\\nArticle Xii of the IMDb Guide for Top Reviewers admonishes us to &#x22;move\\naggressively to correct misconceptions&#x22; about a specific film\\nespecially if &#x22;the majority of viewers seem to have missed the point.&#x22;\\nIt is a tough job but someone has to do it.<br><br>So here is the skinny.

When someone like Robert De Niro turns up in a project beneath\\nhim like &#x27;The Intern&#x27;, you know they were only drawn to it because of\\nthe money. What&#x27;s even more heart-breaking though is that when they\\ntake on more projects of this nature, they become less likely to be\\nacknowledged for films like &#x27;Raging Bull&#x27;, &#x27;The Godfather Part II&#x27; and\\n&#x27;Goodfellas&#x27; by general audiences.<br><br>Ben Whittaker is seventy years old; don&#x27;t worry about remembering this\\nfigure as the film will constantly remind you like a nagging child. He\\nis not enjoying his retirement. When a senior intern program shows up\\nhe jumps at the opportunity and ends up working with his bitter boss (a\\nsickly sweet Anne Hathaway) she just happens to be younger than him.<br><br>I&#x27;m frantically thinking of something, anything to say that&#x27;s positive\\nor of significant note about &#x27;The Intern&#x27; but nothing is coming to my\\nmind. All that I can say in its favour is that it never comes across as\\nhateful about gender, culture or race. But if I&#x27;m praising the film for\\nelements it does not include, should that really count as praise at\\nall? No.<br><br>What I can say is that &#x27;The Intern&#x27; is as predictable as they come. You\\ncould sit there with a checklist waiting to tick off every clich&#xE9; it\\nindulges in. Chances are all the boxes will be ticked by the end. That\\nis if you can make it to the end. This alleged comedy is over two hours\\nlong and this self-indulgent runtime has never worked any favours for\\nthe genre.<br><br>I don&#x27;t want to sit here criticizing &#x27;The Intern&#x27;. I would much rather\\npraise a film than come off as cynical. But when a film is this\\nuninvolving, dull and unfunny I just can&#x27;t.<br><br>I trust you to make up your own mind about whether seeing &#x27;The Intern&#x27;\\nis the right thing to do. So I pose these questions. Do you want to see\\nthe fall of Robert De Niro? A comedy so inert and flat that you can\\nbarely raise a smile? An experience more torturous than a late night\\nshift at work? I do not want to see any of these things. It just makes\\nit all the more easy to decline this internship.\\n', b'\\n<a href=\"/user/ur63164322/\">Leon Starkiller</a> <small>from Argentina</small><br>\\n<small>12 October 2015</small><br>\\n\\n</div>\\n<p>\\nI agreed to watch this movie because I was in a chill out mood and I\\ndidn&#x27;t want to watch anything that made me think too much or that\\nrequired much attention.

Let me start by saying\\nthat I&#x27;m by no means a cinephile, I have seen a few movies in my life\\nand I have opinions, that&#x27;s about it. What&#x27;s amazing about &#x22;The Intern&#x22;\\nis that there is not one single event unfolding on the screen that\\nwould provoke a reaction in the viewer. At some point I felt like\\nchecking people&#x27;s pulses, as we had all been sitting there for more\\nthan an hour and I hadn&#x27;t heard a single comment. This movie is a\\nhorrible display of stereotyped anthropology, both old and new clich&#xE9;s,\\nwith a sequence of facts narrated with no connection whatsoever between\\nthem. It doesn&#x27;t make you cry, it doesn&#x27;t make you laugh, it&#x27;s just a\\ntwo hour long placebo that you would watch if you were part of a\\ncontrol group in a lab. But at least in that case you would get some\\nvouchers. Do not buy any snacks as you&#x27;ll end up with appendicitis,\\ncause you&#x27;ll devour them all in the attempt of killing time. When you\\nfinally think the torture is over, a &#x22;twist&#x22; in the story makes you\\ndread that you will have to watch the extra time of this stalemate\\nbetween boredom and uselessness. One last warning: be ready for the\\ncheesiest lines and shots you&#x27;ve ever seen. Close-up of toothbrushes to\\nsymbolize love, narrative stratagems that don&#x27;t make any sense and a\\nconstant celebration of relationship in the most banal way are the main\\ntraits to this movie. The bottom line of &#x22;The Intern&#x22; is you should\\nkeep working like crazy and eat junk food, as long as you cycle in your\\nown office, have a massive house in the heart of Brooklyn and make\\nmillions with the company you created. There is one good thing about\\nthis film though, and it was leaving the cinema to go home and watch\\nanother one.\\n', b'\\n<a href=\"/user/ur6458242/\">PWNYCNY</a> <small>from United States</small><br>\\n<small>28 September 2015</small><br>\\n\\n</div>\\n<p>\\nDid anyone involved in making this movie really believe that this movie\\nis good? This movie is so shallow that it makes a puddle look like an\\nocean. The idea of mixing a pompously acting Robert De Niro with a\\nhysterically acting Anne Hathaway is an example of how not generate\\non-screen chemistry. Not that the acting is bad. It&#x27;s the story. It&#x27;s\\none ongoing clich&#xE9;. It is a combination of dull, boring, and contrived.\\nIt&#x27;s Father Knows Best meets I Love Lucy, except in this case the\\ncharacters take themselves seriously. This movie manages to take\\nseveral important social themes and reduce them to pulp, and even\\nworse, reduce the principal characters to clich&#xE9;s. A bored older\\nretiree with nothing but time and a manic young business woman. C&#x27;mon!\\nNot exactly the cutting edge of literary originality. And what is\\nworse, they are not funny characters. The supporting cast is funny, but\\nthey are not the principal players. Now the story has potential. The\\nmovie actually starts strongly. The De Niro character is introduced and\\nhis issues clearly presented. Then the movie tanks, and tanks quickly.\\nA promising start leads to a contrived story and muddled finale.

Basically a generation gap drama-comedy\\nwith so many half-formed characters and a sense that it runs too long.\\nAlso, this film proves how political correctness can damage a movie -\\neveryone is so psychotically pleasant, not to mention Jules\\nstay-at-home husband and an adorable daughter in addition to a\\nstimulating career. Also, I haven&#x27;t seen Robert De Niro play such a\\nlikable character in a very long time which here feels like he is\\nlifeless. All of this makes &#x22;The Intern&#x22; a bland movie.<br><br>Verdict: &#x22;The Intern&#x22; has it&#x27;s finger on the pulse of young and old,\\nbut the heartbeat is the thing it fails to detect.

But the\\nwhole time I was watching Robert De Niro playing the sweet, kind\\nintern, drying Anne Hathaway&#x27;s tears and so on, I kept thinking about a\\nmovie he made many years ago called THE FAN.<br><br>THE FAN was this great old-fashioned De Niro movie, the kind our hero\\nused to make when he was really menacing and dangerous. He plays this\\ninsane knife salesman who meets this young black baseball player who&#x27;s\\na superstar but is having personal problems. And then De Niro decides\\nhe has to save this young superstar, but when it doesn&#x27;t work out he\\ngoes berserk!<br><br>The thing that struck me was that THE INTERN and THE FAN share an\\nidentical plot. And that while THE FAN tries to be dark and scary it&#x27;s\\nmore often fall-down laughing funny, like when De Niro&#x27;s character\\nkeeps bragging that he knows Mick Jagger and that they used to &#x22;party\\ntill dawn&#x22; together. Whereas THE INTERN is meant to be funny but is\\nnever fall down laughing funny, except maybe in one scene where De Niro\\nleads a crew of young guys to break into Anne Hathaway&#x27;s mother&#x27;s\\nhouse. (Really, it&#x27;s much funnier than it sounds. I swear I laughed out\\nloud at some point!)<br><br>If only kind old Ben had flipped out at some point . . . like say, when\\nhe finds out his adorable boss&#x27; no good husband is cheating. I swear at\\nthat point I was waiting for De Niro to become his &#x22;true&#x22; self again,\\nand make the snotty young husband pay and pay and pay. He really should\\nhave gone all insane knife salesman on the guy. Or like in CAPE FEAR,\\nhe could have started bombarding the wayward husband with Bible verses\\nand mumbling cryptic warnings like, &#x22;you&#x27;re gonna learn about loss.&#x22; <br><br>Now that&#x27;s comedy!\\n', b'\\n<a href=\"/user/ur63375969/\">wembleyfm</a> <small>from United Kingdom</small><br>\\n<small>18 December 2015</small><br>\\n\\n</div>\\n<p>\\nWithout knowing too much about the plot, I assumed this was taking De\\nNiro down a familiar trodden path of another &#x22;Fokker&#x22; type role. How\\nwrong I was! This is a very endearing, gentle and easily watchable\\nescapade that sees an ageing De Niro being given an internship with an\\ne-commerce fashion company and becoming surprisingly useful at\\nbestowing his considerable knowledge to his new colleagues. I can&#x27;t\\nremember ever seeing De Niro play such a likable role without seemingly\\nany flaws to his character.
